## NEONPINK
Welcome to NEONPINK! This simple yet addictive game will challenge your reflexes as you navigate your way through a sea of circles, grow bigger, and try to score as high as possible.

**Note: NEONPINK offers a true web3 experience through the use of IPFS and an ENS name.**

## How to Play
1. Your objective is to survive as long as you can by avoiding collisions with the white circles.
2. You control the pink circle using the arrow keys (or W, A, S, D keys).
3. As you successfully avoid collisions, your player will grow in size, and your score will increase.
4. If the pink circle collides with an enemy and the enemy is smaller, your circle will grow, and you will gain points.
5. If the pink circle collides with an enemy that is bigger, it's game over.
